# Calculus
A one-header libary with an overwhelmingly creative name for lots of simple Calculus I & II concepts.

## Building
It's a single header file. If you really need build instructions, here are some simple steps on linux:

* `cd Calculus/`
* `cat Calculus.h | cat > Calculus.h`

Now just `#include "Calculus.h"` and you're set.

## Usage
See `Calculus.h` for all methods. 

See `docs/` for HTML doxygen documentation.

## Notes
Accuraccy could be improved but it's great for general-purpose.
